This is a "first try" package intended to use LilyPond's feta font in LaTeX documents.

In order to make it work, you have to copy these files in your local texmf folder (depending on your platform and TeX installation).


fetatolatex.sty
---------------

This file has to be placed in the tex folder of your texmf tree

fonts
-----
The folders included in fonts are the following : enc, map, source and type1. They include feta and old-feta subfolder that must be placed in the same way (according to subfolder names). If a folder or subfolder doesn't exist, you may create it.

test.tex
--------
This is a same TeX file intended to test the installation. Is includes a few glyphs and a table showing how the commands behave in a simple LaTeX structure.

Most commands have to be followed by {} in order to allow correct spacing with the following text.
